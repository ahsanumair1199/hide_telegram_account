I made a simple python script to hide my real telegram account from public world

Anyone can still having conversation with me without knowing my real account

How does it works?

RANDOM-USER <-> TELEGRAM BOT <-> GROUP CHAT <-> REAL ACCOUNT

Basically, you give other user a link to your telegram bot, then the bot do the heavy works

Anyone on the group chat can reply to the message, and then the bot will forward it to original sender

Requirements:

1. Python3 & PIP
2. pip3 install pyrogram tgcrypto
3. run the script (more documentation are on the script comments)
